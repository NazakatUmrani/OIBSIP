This repository contains the source code and documentation for three different Android applications that I developed during my one-month internship on Android App development. The apps are:

1. Unit Converter Application: This app allows users to convert different units of measurement, such as length, weight, volume, and temperature. It includes a simple and user-friendly interface that enables users to select the type of unit they want to convert and enter the corresponding value. The app then displays the converted value, along with a brief explanation of the conversion process.

2. Calculator: This app is a simple and intuitive calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes a sleek and minimalist design that makes it easy to use and navigate.

3. Quiz Application: This app provides users with an interactive and engaging way to test their knowledge on a particular topic. It includes a database of questions and answers, which users can access by selecting a category. The app then presents the questions one at a time and allows users to select their answers. It also includes a score tracker that shows users how well they performed on the quiz.

Overall, this repository serves as a comprehensive guide to my internship project and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about Android app development, particularly with respect to building unit converters, calculators, and quiz applications.
